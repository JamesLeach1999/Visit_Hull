This is a practise project I am using to learn how to create a secure, backend functional website in PHP. Bare in mind, this is mainly for educational purposes

Hello all. This is my first medium-large scale project written in PHP. I am a student who wanted to create a content managment system in order to improve my skills and learn the foundations of creating functioning websites.

The website itself is fairly straight forward. There is a public facing part of the website and an admin area. The admin area requires a secure login in order to change the content of the site and uses MySQL to do this.

I could've made the actual content of the site look nicer by inputting html into the MySQL table however my aim was to learn PHP and MySQL, not html again.

There are some odd variable names here and there but overall it was just to try implementing dynamic content into a website.

The admin area allows you to insert, edit, preview and delete subjects and pages within the site. The pages are nested within the subjects and uses the subjects ID as a foreign key to align themselves appropriately.

The comments in the code are mainly for my use as when I come back to it, each section of code is explained.

I hope to use this as a jumping off point before endeavouring on greater challenges. Please do not consider this my best work, as I fully believe my best work is still to come
